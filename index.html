            <p class="text-box">Hello! My name is Nathan Shaw. I grew up in Mexico from the ages of 3 years old up to 9 years of age, until I moved back into California and lived primarily in the 
                City of Costa Mesa. I went to school at Corona Del Mar High School and then moved onto Orange Coast College after graduating.
            </p>

            <p class="text-box">I've had a strong interest in music growing up, and began to teach myself how to play bass guitar. Eventually I began to learn how to record full bands, and mix the music as well.
                Now I work as an audio engineer on the side as a hobby! When I'm not living in the music world back at home, I enjoy getting away and camping up in National Parks, such as Sequoia, Mammoth Mountain
                Joshua Tree, and many more!
            </p>

            <p class="text-box">I've worked in retail for most of my working life. My longest and current job has been working at Whole Foods Market, being an Order Writer for the wine department, only to move up shortly
                into a leadership role, overseeing the adult beverage and artisinal cheese department, and being in charge of an amazing team!

            </p>
