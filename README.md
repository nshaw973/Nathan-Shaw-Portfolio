# 02 Advanced CSS: Portfolio

## My Task

The task this time around was to create a portfolio to build on, and use in the future for employers to showcase skills and projects previously worked on with a bio, links to deployed work, and a contact section.

Currently there are no projects to showcase so for the time being, placeholder images have been added with a coming soon header per application.

## Acceptance Criteria 

The acceptance criteria required for the project goes as follows

```
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
```
